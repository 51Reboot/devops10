In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. This is in contrast with imperative programming, which implements algorithms in explicit steps.

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates. The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.

##### 命令式编程：命令“机器”如何去做事情(how)，这样不管你想要的是什么(what)，它都会按照你的命令实现。
